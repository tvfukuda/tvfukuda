Hi, my name is Tsuyoshi Fukuda and I am electronics engineer with 30+ years of experience in R&D of automation, consumer electronics and telecommunications industries.

This repository was created to upload my learnings on topics related to data science, mainly attending the degree at [Let's Code](https://letscode.com.br/).
